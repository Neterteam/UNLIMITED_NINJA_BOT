# UN_BOT Python

Wanted to test myself to see if I could automate a browser game. Weird, yes worth it, debatable. Needed to find a way to do it. Tried many methods and ended with automated mouse clicks. I know sue me :p. * Everything you see here is a work in progress. Will update whenever I can. *
